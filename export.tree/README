Necka, E., Senderecka, M., Kucharzyk, B., Falkiewicz, M. (2015). "Who can afford self-control? The neural efficiency mechanism explains effective self-regulation of behavior".

Subjects performed 3 sessions of figural 2-back task with lures on n-1 position. They were instructed to press a button when the target is present and withhold reaction when a lure was present. 

Behavioral tests included trait self-control questionnaire AS36 (publication submitted), filled by both the participant and his/her two friends. The questionnaire consists of three subscales:
switching, monitoring and inhibition. Additionally, IQ test scores (Raven's Progressive Matrices and TAO) are included in last two columns. All additional scores are included in demographics.txt in columns 5-15:

1. dataset number
2. subject
3. sex
4. age
5. AS36, switching, self-rated
6. AS36, switching, 1st friend rating
7. AS36, switching, 2nd friend rating
8. AS36, monitoring, self-rated
9. AS36, monitoring, 1st friend rating
10. AS36, monitoring, 2nd friend rating
11. AS36, inhibition, self-rated
12. AS36, inhibition, 1st friend rating
13. AS36, inhibition, 2nd friend rating
14. RPM
15. TAO

Note that the order of friends is arbitrary.
